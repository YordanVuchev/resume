I dont have any real c++ projects yet, the only thing that i have done close to a project was a simple snake game in the console
and i have also developed a program that was solving polynomials. Most of the times i was only solving problems using the language.

I have built a number of data bases which were just for exercising and to practice the things that i learned. I have also built a
data base for the project rodnapamet that i was working in with the other programmers.
